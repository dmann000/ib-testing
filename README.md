https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x_okhl_CF4


got ubuntu installed and up.  I've run the following:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade #command
sudo sed -i 's/^PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
sudo apt install xrdp xfce4 xfce4-goodies tightvncserver -y
echo xfce4-session> /home/ubuntu/.xsession
sudo cp /home/ubuntu/.xsession /etc/skel
sudo sed -i '0,/-1/s//ask-1/' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
sudo service xrdp restart

# got rdp over putty... login screen pops up

# I'm unable to log in as ubuntu and don't see the same option as the video.
